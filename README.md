# BBS3004_Radiomics_Project
This is an open teaching resource for a short project inUniversity Maastricht Bach Biomedical Science

## Step 1 : Introduction to Radiomics
At the end of this first step, you would be able to do all of the following :
1. Describe quantitatively what is the information that is contained within one of the following three-dimensional clinical imaging modalities - Computed Tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance (MR), Positron Emission Tomography PET).
2. Describe a few of the tasks that a radiation oncologist or radiologist would need to do to prepare an image for quantitative analysis.
3. Explain to another colleague in the BBS course, what is radiomics and what are the principle steps to be done in a radiomics analysis.
4. Access a public open source of images for radiomics analysis.

## Step 2 : Getting and understanding the data
At the end of this second step, you would be able to do all of the following :
1. Know how to look up well-know imaging repositories and then obtain some public clinical images of CT, MR or PET
2. Be able to open, view and understand how medical imaging files are organized in the DICOM standard

## Step 3 : Radiomics features
At the end of this third step, you would be able to do all of the following :
1. Know how to extract radiomic features from medical images using an open source software package
2. Be able to discuss what kind of computational setting may have an effect on the radiomics features that are computed

## Step 4 : Feature selection
At the end of this fourth step, you would be able to do all of the following :
1. Explain why it is almost always advisable to reduce the number of radiomics features available for a given prediction problem
2. Describe at least 2 methods by which feature dimensionality could be significantly reduced
3. Propose and execute one of these methods on the dataset(s) that you have downloaded

## Step 5 : Fitting a prediction model
At the end of this fifth step, you would be able to do all of the following :
1. Explain why is it strongly recommended to separate available data in a study into training, test and validation sets
2. Justify what woud be a suitable choice of predictive performance for the model you have chosen
3. Be able to develop a simple prediction model and know how to solve for the coefficients of your selected model

## Step 6 : Validating an existing prediction model
At the end of this sixth and final step, you would be able to do all of the following :
1. Know how to design a validation of a prediction model that you or a colleague (or as a group) have developed
2. Discuss some reason why a validation of a prediction model might be good or bad or indifferent
